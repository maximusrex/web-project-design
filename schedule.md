  - [Assignment 1](./assignments.md): Take a piece of writing from another class - this should be no more than a few pages, and create an html file with this text as the content. Use paragraph tags and heading tags to structure this content, and perhaps bold and italics. Think about the size of the fonts, font-face, and readability. Link to this html file from your index page and post it in your public_html folder.

As you're completing this discrete task, take some moments to reflect on your experience and write down your observations. What is the experience like? What steps did you have to take to achieve the result? (be detailed!) What elements of the interface did you most engage with? Were these legible? And how? How did you know how to complete the task you set for yourself? Think about layout, icons, input fields, input methods, etc. What elements of the experience, if any, gave you trouble? Why?

HTML/CSS Review I

[Slides for August 26, 2021](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vT89GDCdkZ_H-NSQZFE1ULp0t4Lkk3zVIjLh9yx_4J8Xux5grxFa2EsUnWcMIx5ni-9ICPxx-58RgU_/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)

- In Class
  - PC Setup troubleshooting
  - HTML/CSS Review: creating files, html syntax, structuring content, file structure, linking, styling text and typography, responsive design & media queries
- Homework
  - Post an index.html in your public_html folder if you don't already have one there. This is your "home page" where you'll be posting content and links to content from time to time. You may style and structure this page as you wish.
    **Please make sure this page has clear navigation and links to any relevant class content, like the following assignment:**
  - [Assignment 1](./assignments.md/#assignment-1-format-an-essay-or-article): Take a piece of writing from another class - this should be no more than a few pages, and create an html file with this text as the content. Use paragraph tags and heading tags to structure this content and style it with CSS. Think about the elements of readability, structure, and context, as discussed in class and in the reading. Post this .html file to your CIFS server space, and link to it from your index.html page.

    - [Beth Tondreau, Layout Essentials: 100 Design Principles for Using Grids, "Getting Started"](https://sakai.duke.edu/access/content/group/85af1ecd-462a-4d0a-b865-bd4fe108f074/Readings/Tondreau_LayoutEss_GettingStarted.pdf)
    - [Interaction Design Foundation, "The Grid System: Building a Solid Design Layout"](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/the-grid-system-building-a-solid-design-layout)
  - Some Sample Grid Systems and Frameworks with Grids
    - [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) isn't a grid system, but it is a way of laying out, aligning, and spacing elements in a container, even if the size of the container changes by altering their width, height and order to best fit the available space, so is an easy way to incorporate responsive design
    - CSS Grid Layout is native to CSS. It can allow you to make either a row/column grid system, but also allows for many other systems and overlapping elements. See the [MDN Docs on CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) and [CSS-Tricks: A complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
    - [W3.css](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_grid.asp), a css framework with grid system by W3 Schools
    - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is a very popular css framework that includes a grid layout system, as well as many other UI elements
    - [Dead Simple Grid](http://mourner.github.io/dead-simple-grid/) a lightweight css grid system that only has two main classes: row and col
    - [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/#intro) Another simple grid system that uses easy to read class names like "container", "row" and "two columns" or "five columns"

As you're completing this discrete task, take some moments to reflect on your experience and write down your observations. What is the experience like? What steps did you have to take to achieve the result? (be detailed!) What elements of the interface did you most engage with? Were these legible? And how? How did you know how to complete the task you set for yourself? Think about layout, icons, input fields, input methods, etc. What elements of the experience, if any, gave you trouble? Why?

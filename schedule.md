- In Class
  - PC Setup troubleshooting
  - HTML/CSS Review: creating files, html syntax, structuring content, file structure, linking, styling text and typography, responsive design & media queries
- Homework
  - Post an index.html in your public_html folder if you don't already have one there. This is your "home page" where you'll be posting content and links to content from time to time. You may style and structure this page as you wish.
    **Please make sure this page has clear navigation and links to any relevant class content, like the following assignment:**
  - [Assignment 1](./assignments.md/#assignment-1-format-an-essay-or-article): Take a piece of writing from another class - this should be no more than a few pages, and create an html file with this text as the content. Use paragraph tags and heading tags to structure this content and style it with CSS. Think about the elements of readability, structure, and context, as discussed in class and in the reading. Post this .html file to your CIFS server space, and link to it from your index.html page.

[Demo: Geolocation and Fetch()](https://github.com/maximusrex/web-project-design/tree/gh-pages/demos/9_30_21_Fetch)

- In Class
  - Looking Ahead: Building the JS toolkit with libraries & APIs
  - Intro to APIs: Browser APIs vs 3rd Party APIs
  - Example browser APIs: Fetch(), Geolocation
- Homework
  - Read/Do:
    - MDN Docs, [Introduction to web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs)
    - [Khan Academy: Using JS Libraries in Your WebPage](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css-js/using-js-libraries-in-your-webpage/a/whats-a-js-library)
  - **Over Break**: research JavaScript libraries, frameworks, and APIs for use in your final projects over break for [Assignment #6](./assignments.md/#assignment-6-api--library-research)
    - Resources for your search
      - [Awesome JavaScript:](https://github.com/sorrycc/awesome-javascript) a collection of libraries, frameworks, and other resources
      - [Wikipedia List of JS Libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JavaScript_libraries)
      - We'll be learning to use the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library, but only touching the surface of its functionality. Check out their [2021 Showcase](https://showcase.p5js.org/#/2021-All) of projects made with the help of p5, and some of the [other libraies](https://p5js.org/libraries/) that can extend it.
      - We'll also be learning [The React.js library](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html) for building UI. MDN has [their own set of tutorials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_getting_started) for react.
      - There are also libraries for [animation](https://animejs.com/), [data visualization](https://d3js.org/), [lightbox image display](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/), and even functions as specific as [animating text to look like its being typed](http://mattboldt.github.io/typed.js/)
      - There are tons of great 3rd Party APIs to get data and other functionality. We'll be looking at the Twitter API, the NYTimes API, and a few others that require authenticaion and a developer account. [Here's a great list](https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets) of APIs for accessing different kinds of data in JSON format that DO NOT require authentication.
      - If you want to create something more experimental for the next project, it might also help to look at the work of other creative coders to get an idea of what you can do:
        - [Darius Kazemi](http://tinysubversions.com/)
        - [Allison Parrish](https://www.decontextualize.com/)
        - [Dan Shiffman](https://shiffman.net/)
          - Dan Shiffman also has a number of tutorials for specific projects like [making twitter bots](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6atTSxoRiVnSuOn6JHnq2yV) and [Machine Learning in JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26uABexmOX4&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YPSwT06y_AEYTqIwbeam3y)

### October 7, 2021

JavaScript IIb: Adding a Library

- In Class
  - Review of client-side http calls: Fetch(), promises, .then(), async/await, interpreting the readable stream
  - Javascript Libraries intro: galleries, maps, more
  - Building from navigator.geolocate and other location data - now add a map! [(with Leaflet.js)](https://leafletjs.com/)
- Homework
  - Library & API research
  - Use what we've been working on over the past two lessons to make an html page that 1) gets some data from an api source (check [this list](https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets) of JSON datasets that don't require authentication) and 2) either displays the data returned in the page or uses a mapping or other .js library to visualize it
    - Hint: if you're trying a different api from the list, go to the link - the url will usually be the link you want to fetch(). Pay attention to the structure of the JSON returned to understand how you can traverse the JSON to find what data you want. Some APIs [Like reddit's return for r/todayilearned.json](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned.json), which returns the latest posts in the Reddit subreddit "Today I Learned" will give you a ton of highly structured data containing locations, timestamps, and images. And, by the way, you can get the results from ANY subreddit by replacing the [subreddit name].json at the end of the URL endpoint. The latest posts in the subreddit [r/aww](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww) are at: https://www.reddit.com/r/aww.json
    - When finished, post the .html page to your webspace and link to it from your home page

Javascript IIc: Interactive Canvas with P5.js Library

- In Class
  - Intro to p5.js
  - p5.js canvas
  - P5.js beyond the canvas - libraries, plugins, helpers
- Homework
  - Prep for Oct 14th Class: Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (on Mac), which is a helpful package installer for Mac and Linux, and/or follow the installation guides for Node.js [on Mac](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html) or [on a Windows PC](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/windows/node-windows.html). On Mac, you will need Homebrew as a helper to install node.js, on PC you will not.
  - Node requires that you use the Command Line Interface on your PC. If you don't have much experience with the command line outside of this course, you might want to check out [A Beginner's Guide to Using the Mac Terminal](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/beginners-guide-mac-terminal/) or [A Beginner's Guide to the Windows Command Prompt](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/a-beginners-guide-to-the-windows-command-line/). We'll be making extensive use of the Terminal available within VS Code
  - Optional, rn: Eventually, you'll also need accounts with the following services if you don't already have them - [Github](https://github.com/) for version control. You'll also need the [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/) for pushing to Github from terminal. I'f you've already completed the above steps for installing Node with homebrew, you can simply <code>$ brew install gh</code> in your terminal
  - [Heroku](http://heroku.com), a cloud based app platform, and a simple way to host applications built with Node.js. And, you'll need the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli), which you can also install with Homebrew in the terminal
    **Node is a JavaScript runtime that allows us to run JS code outside of the browser context for server-side application development**

				<h1>Adding React to your HTML site</h1>
				<p>
					React is a component-based library for building UI in JavaScript Apps.
					It uses JSX, an extension of JavaScript, which allows you to declare
					custom UI components.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can use React components without building a React app from scratch
					by calling the CDN files in script tags in your document. Follow
					<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html"
						>this tutorial</a
					>
					to practice on your own with this method.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="https://reactjs.org/">The React Homepage</a> also has a few
					simple examples with an in-browser editor so you can get used to what
					react components look like and how they work
				</p>
				<p>The elements below are rendered with React. See the script tags.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="root" class="w3-card w3-panel"></div>
		</div>
		<!-- Load React. -->
		<!-- Note: when deploying, replace "development.js" with "production.min.js". -->
		<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@^16/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
		<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.13.0/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
		<script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6.26.0/babel.js"></script>
		<script type="text/babel">
			//react code goes here, this is in JSX, which is being compiled in the browser using the Babel library
			class App extends React.Component {
				render() {
					return (
						<div className="App">
							<h1>Hello World</h1>
							<p>This is a react component</p>
						</div>
					);
				}
			}
			//now render that element

			ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
			// note - if we were to deploy this, we're getting a warning in the inspector.  We'd want to pre-compile this code for production: https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#add-jsx-to-a-project

/**

// defining a function

// invoking a function

// anonymous function

// anonymous function as callback for another function

// function scope

// function arguments

/*
 * Methods are actions that can be performed on objects, or functions defined within objects
 */

// example of an object with a method

// invoking the method

/* JS also has a number of built in methods and objects that we've already discussed like the document object.  There is also the window object, the Math object, which has a number of helpful math methods (see line 59, above) */

//Math object
console.log(Math.round(77.89)); //round to integer
console.log(Math.ceil(77.89)); //round up to integer
console.log(Math.floor(77.89)); //round down to integer

//see: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_math.asp for all Math methods

//Math.random() returns a random number between 0 and 1
console.log(Math.random() * 100); //returns integers between 0 and 100

/*
 *  Events
 * See MDN Listing of events and DOM objects associated: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events

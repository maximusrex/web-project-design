			<h1>The Fetch() API</h1>
			<p>
				The <a href="">Fetch()</a> web API is a browser API that allows you to
				make HTTP requests and handle responses from the client-side in
				JavaScript.
			</p>
			<p>
				Because the fetch function here is grabbing the image as an asynchronous
				network request, you'll need to be running a local server to get this to
				work locally on your own computer.
			</p>
			<p>
				We'll be working with server-side scripting in the next several classes.
				For now, you can run a quick server in VS Code to use Fetch() with a
				plugin like
				<a
					href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer"
					>Live Server</a
				>. Install the Live Server plugin in VS code, then right-click this file
				in VS Code and select "open with live server". This will open the file
				in a browser window. Notice URL address for the file now begins with
				with "http://127.0.0.1" rather than "file:///Users".

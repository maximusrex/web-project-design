    <!--This is the head of the document where you link to external CSS and JS files-->
    <!--and this is how you call the external css file.  
        The call below links to an external file called style.css next 
        to this file in the document tree-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
    <!--You can Also add styles between style tags, inline in your HTML, as below, 
    but this is best used for quick testing or to override something referenced in the style sheet, above-->

    <h1>This is an html file</h1>
    <p>
      Its contents are written in HTML, or HyperText Markup Language. HTML
      documents contain regular text and multimedia contents, structured by
      "tags" to make those contents readable and meaningful for the browser,
      scripts, and styles.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, the contents of this paragraph are surrounded by a
      <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_p.asp">"p" tag.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      And so are these. Right click this page (wherever, really) and select
      "inspect element" to open up Developer tools and see the html that
      structures this document.
    </p>
    <p>
      The structural semantics HTML provides for content adds meta-information
      to it. HTML tags can have
      <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp"
        >Attributes</a
      >
      that define additional information about the content, like styles, links,
      data, identifying information like classes and IDs, etc.
      <br />
      <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3 Schools</a> has a
      number of free tutorials and references for HTML (and CSS and JavaScript).
      It's a good tool to keep open in a browser tab while you code.

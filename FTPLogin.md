## FTP/CIFS Login Instructions

As a duke student you are provided with a little bit (5GB) of server space on the [Duke CIFS server space](https://oit.duke.edu/what-we-do/applications/cifs). You can find and display this site at http://people.duke.edu/~yourNetID. For example, my server space is located at http://people.duke.edu/~mjs97 (or go [here](http://people.duke.edu/~mjs97)). As with any web server, if your public_html folder does not have an index.html (or home.html) file, you'll see an index listing of this folder.

For this class, you'll be posting content to this folder, and the first thing we will do is create an index.html file.

You can connect to the space and edit/update the files there via a few different methods. We will cover these in the second day of class, but please try to login first using one of the following methods, and using your duke login credentials (NetID and Password).

\_note that with any of these methods, because you're making a secure connection to edit files on Duke Servers, you will need to either be on Duke's WiFi network or logged in to the Duke VPN with [Cisco Anyconnect VPN](https://oit.duke.edu/what-we-do/services/vpn).

1. [Filezilla](https://oit.duke.edu/help/articles/kb0021904): login with the Filezilla FTP client software. Works on Mac and PC with software download.
2. [Mac OS method](https://oit.duke.edu/help/articles/kb0013637) using Finder-->Go-->Connect to Server.
3. [Windows method](https://oit.duke.edu/help/articles/kb0013655) using Map Network Drive.

# Assignments

1. ## Assignment 1: Format an Essay or Article

   **Due September 2, 2021**
   Take a piece of writing you have done in the past. It may be a poem, blog post, or essay, around 1,000-1,500 words. Format and structure this content using HTML tags, and style it with CSS for readability and aesthetics.

   Feel free to add images or other multimedia content, but make sure to consider how you want to position these elements with text.

   If you're not comfortable sharing your own writing, you may excerpt writing you find elsewhere, but please remember to credit and link to the original.

   Things you should consider

   - Font(s)
   - Font size and style
   - Colors, background-color and contrast
   - Line height
   - Layout and width on the page
   - Alignment
   - Semantic hierarchy with headers, paragraphs, and lists

   Add a link to this file from the index.html file we created in class (your home page) and upload it (along with any necessary .css files) to your CIFS server space.

2. ## Assignment 2: Apply a Grid Layout to Your Content

   **Due September 7, 2021**
   Using the techniques discussed in class for layout (grid, flexbox, and css frameworks) and either:
   a. apply a grid layout to the essay you styled for the previous assignment. You can do this on one page, or across multiple pages. Consider how you might want to position embedded images, videos, or other content.
   or
   b. create a pure html-css layout experiment. You can use the grid to compose with color, work with layering with opacity, z-index, and absolute positioning, or try to reproduce a layout from any website you like. Remember to credit your sources.

3. ## Sitemap, Wireframes, and Midterm Website Proposal

   **Due September 16, 2021**
   This is your time to start planning the site you want to build for the midterm project. This could be a personal website, a site presenting a project you've done, or an MVP (minimum viable prototype) for your final project.

   Wireframes: For this first part of the assignment you need to map out the basic concept and information architecture (how any subfolders, pages, or contents are related to one another) and basic wireframe sketches for your page designs. At this point, think about basic and general questions like: where does the navigation go? What does this menu link to? Is everything on one page.

   Proposal: Please explain in a paragraph or two the basic point of your site, whether it's a basic personal website, a site to display a project, a standalone web art work, or a design for a future web app. Explain the flow of the information architecture you mapped out in your provisional wireframes, and describe the user interactions you imagine on the site. How do you get around the site? Are there any text input fields? Buttons to click? Links to follow? Etc.

   In the end, the midterm website will have

   - (at least) 5 html web pages and one or more CSS files
   - CSS Typography and spacing
   - CSS grid/flexbox or framework based layout (e.g. bootstrap or w3.css)
   - at least 1-2 CSS3 [transitions](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp)or [animations](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp). (See also: [This CSS3 cheatsheet](https://www.kirupa.com/html5/css_transitions_cheatsheet.htm)).
   - 3-4 Embedded media (images, video, sound, iframe) - have as many as you'd like but be aware of your image resolution and size!
   - at least 2 elements styled or rendered dynamically using vanilla JavaScript (no libraries or frameworks, not even jquery). These can be simple. For example:
     - Changing visibility of an element or background color on click
     - use Javascript to change an element's CSS definitions
     - Or something like [a clickable dropdown](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_dropdown.asp)
     - I encourage you to search the web for more examples. Try googling "javascript" and the thing you want to do like "dropdown menu" or "change background image"

4. ## Assignment 4: Design Iteration

   **Be ready to discuss in class on September 23**
   For this assignment you're going to iterate through the wireframes and design ideas from your proposal and start adding real content. At this point, you should be moving from dummy content and lorem ipsum to real images and text and planning out a "style guide" for your site. What is your color palette? What fonts will you use for heading and text? What images and other media will you use? How will you position these elements?

   You can work directly in CSS/HTML and/or work from wireframes

   The deliverable for this assignment is a 1-page writeup showing your fonts, colors, and an image of your wireframe iterations in a .html file.

   At this point, you should also be building out your site in HTML/CSS.

5. ## Assignment 5: Midterm Website

   **Due online (posted to/as your main website at people.duke.edu) Sept. 30**

   The midterm website can be either a website of your conception and creation: a personal site, a site displaying a project, an "experimental artwork" delivered via website, or a site architecture and design for a js-enabled application you plan on building in the second part of the class. The point of this assignment is to get you quickly building and working with real content on the web.

   Your completed midterm site should have:

   - (at least) 5 html web pages and one or more CSS files, and
     - CSS Typography and spacing
     - CSS grid/flexbox or framework based layout (e.g. bootstrap or w3.css)
     - at least 1-2 CSS3 [transitions](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp)or [animations](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp). (See also: [This CSS3 cheatsheet](https://www.kirupa.com/html5/css_transitions_cheatsheet.htm)).
     - 3-4 Embedded media (images, video, sound, iframe) - have as many as you'd like but be aware of your image resolution and size!
     - at least 2 elements styled or rendered dynamically using vanilla JavaScript (no libraries or frameworks, not even jquery).

6. ## Assignment 6: Library & Plugin Research

   **Due Online Oct 7**
   Find 2-3 Javascript Libraries, Plugins, or Frameworks you are interested in or would like to incorporate into a project.

   Write up a brief on each one, with links, explaining its main uses and post this to your site to share in-class by Oct 7.

7. ## Assignment 7: Midterm Peer Crit

   **Due Oct 14**

8. ## Assignment 8: Final Project Proposal and Wireframes

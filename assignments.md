# Assignments

1. Format an Essay or Article
   **Due September 2, 2021**
   Take a piece of writing you have done in the past. It may be a poem, blog post, or essay, around 1,000-1,500 words. Format and structure this content using HTML tags, and style it with CSS for readability and aesthetics.

   Feel free to add images or other multimedia content, but make sure to consider how you want to position these elements with text.

   If you're not comfortable sharing your own writing, you may excerpt writing you find elsewhere, but please remember to credit and link to the original.

   Things you should consider

   - Font(s)
   - Font size and style
   - Colors, background-color and contrast
   - Line height
   - Layout and width on the page
   - Alignment
   - Semantic hierarchy with headers, paragraphs, and lists

   Add a link to this file from the index.html file we created in class (your home page) and upload it (along with any necessary .css files) to your CIFS server space.

2. Apply a grid layout to your essay
   **Due September 7, 2021**
   Using the techniques discussed in class for layout (grid, flexbox, and css frameworks) and either:
   a. apply a grid layout to the essay you styled for the previous assignment. You can do this on one page, or across multiple pages. Consider how you might want to position embedded images, videos, or other content.
   or
   b. create a pure html-css layout experiment. You can use the grid to compose with color, work with layering with opacity, z-index, and absolute positioning, or try to reproduce a layout from any website you like. Remember to credit your sources.

3. Sitemap, Wireframes, and Midterm Website Proposal
   **Due September 16, 2021**
   This is your time to start planning the site you want to build for the midterm project. This could be a personal website, a site presenting a project you've done, or an MVP (minimum viable prototype) for your final project.

   In the end, the midterm website will have at least

   - 5 html web pages and one or more CSS files
   - CSS Typography and spacing
   - CSS grid/flexbox or framework based layout (e.g. bootstrap or w3.css)
   - at least 1-2 CSS3 transitions or animations
   - Embedded media (images, video, sound, iframe)
   - at least 2 elements styled or rendered dynamically using vanilla JavaScript (no libraries or frameworks). For example:
   - Changing visibility or background color on click
   -

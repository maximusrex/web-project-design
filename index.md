## Welcome to Web Project Design and Development

Fall 2021, ISS 241 / VMS 257 / ISS/CMAC 741

This course covers the design and development of user-centered and interactive projects for the web using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It builds on the material introduced in _Fundamentals of Web-Based Multimedia Communications_, and students should have prior experience with HTML/CSS.

[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/About_JavaScript) is the language for scripting user interaction in the web browser, from animating client-site UI components to full-stack apps built on Express/Node.js, and we will cover much of the ground between these. The first two weeks of the course will focus on a review of HTML/CSS and we will begin building toward the [Midterm Project](/), a personal website with styling, layout, and JS-enabled UI components. We'll also create wireframes and cover the basics of UX research and user-centered design. Then, we'll introduce JavaScript, and work briefly with syntax and understanding the parts of the language before setting out to develop interactive final projects supported by [JavaScript Libraries](), [Browser and Third-Party APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Introduction), and [FrameWorks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks) like [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) to build lightweight, scalable, and dynamic UIs for the web.

### Expectations

The first secret of coding for the web is that you can teach yourself how to code for the web, on the web. In this course you'll often be expected to help yourself by reading documentation, watching tutorials, consulting references, searching forums like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), and some plain old googling. In class, we will work together in a demo format and you will be expected to follow along on your own machine and learn by doing.

This is also a course in _visual and media studies_ so we will be engaging in critical looking and critical making. Technical exercises for learning and building with HTML/CSS and JavaScript will be supplemented by readings on user-centered design and critical technical practice. You'll be asked to notice the designed world around you, both on the web and off, and engage in constructive analysis and criticism of your own and your colleagues' designs in the classroom.

If I could pick another title for this course I would have called it **Super-User**. Ultimately, it is designed to provide you with the skills to be a critical consumer and producer of web-based technologies and inspire you to keep building.

### Requirements

- Technical Requirements
  - A Personal Laptop computer
  - Software
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (free download), a code editor for creating and editing .html, .css, and .js files
    - [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/), a free FTP client for uploading/downloading content from a web server
    - Google Chrome or Firefox with Developer tools
    - [Cisco AnyConnect](https://oit.duke.edu/what-we-do/services/vpn), the Duke VPN software for logging into the Duke CIFS servers remotely
  - Computer / Server Set-up
    - For the most part, we will be using the Duke CIFS server space to serve static web content. [Set up your CIFS space with these instructions](./FTPLogin.md).
    - We will also be making extended use of the Terminal Application (Mac), or the Windows Command Prompt (PC). This is a way of navigating files (and doing a bunch of other things) in your computer by text command, without the graphical user interface (GUI). In a way, Terminal is it's own GUI, with text input instead of mousing around and clicking on icons. We will spend some time in class getting used to Terminal/Command Prompt, but to start you may want to check out these guides.
      - On PC use [this guide](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/a-beginners-guide-to-the-windows-command-line/) for Command Line
      - On Mac use [this guide](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/beginners-guide-mac-terminal/) for Terminal
